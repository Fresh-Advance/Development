# Development base

Docker based local development environment. Php and Npm users are synced with the current user, so we will have all the rights to modify and access the content generated by using container commands.

## What we have here

For the start:

* Apache 2.4 
* PHP 7.4 fpm with: 
   * xDebug preconfigured with profiler preconfigured
   * remote debuggind preconfigured
   * error reporting enabled
* MySQL 5.7 with adminer
* Mailhog preconfigured to catch outgoing emails
* Npm

## Requirements

* Docker (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* Docker compose (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Quick start

```
git clone https://github.com/Sieg/development.git myProjectName
cd myProjectName

make setup
make up
```

Access the website through the http://localhost
* phpinfo shown on index page
* example with database connection
* example with email sending and catching it with mailhog
    * run the composer install on php container first.

Adminer is available via http://localhost:8080
* Server: mysql
* Credentials: root/root

Mailhog is available via http://localhost:8025/

## Running php stuff

Call commands directly on the container:
```
docker-compose run php php -v
```

Login to the container, and run the commands from inside:
```
docker-compose exec php bash
php -v
```

Alternatively:
```
make php
php -v
```

## Running npm commands

```
docker-compose run node npm install bootstrap
```
