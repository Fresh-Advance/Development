# Development base

Docker based local development environment. Php and Npm users are synced with the current user, so we will have all the rights to modify and access the content generated by using container commands.

## What we have here

For the start:

* Apache 2.4 
* PHP 7.4 fpm with xDebug, remote debuggind and error reporting enabled
* MySQL 5.7 with adminer
* Npm

## Quick start

```
git clone https://github.com/Sieg/development.git myProjectName
cd myProjectName

./build.sh
docker-compose up --build -d
```

Access the website through the http://localhost

Adminer is available via http://localhost:8080

## Running php stuff

Call commands directly on the container:
```
docker-compose run php php -v
```

Login to the container, and run the commands from inside:
```
docker-compose exec php bash
php -v
```

## Running npm commands

```
docker-compose run node npm install bootstrap
```
